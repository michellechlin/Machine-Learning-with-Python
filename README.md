## General Info

This repository is to use Python and Jupyter Notebook to learn data science and machine learning. This course, taught by Jose Portilla, sets a right amount of structure and flexibility to learn fundamental concepts with NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, Machine Learning (ML), Tensorflow, Natural Language Process and Deep Learning. 
The concepts were well-explained on just about everything to some degree; however, the theory of machine learning algorithms is not covered too much. 
You might be interested in pairing this course with a more theory-intensive course Andrew Ng's ML course using MATLAB programming on Coursera (see another repository). 

## Technologies
I completed this course with:
* Mac Terminal Command
* Anaconda Python 3 
* Jupyter Notebook
* AWS EC2 for Big Data and PySpark Section

## Usage

Click Terminal to open the terminal window.
```
$ jupyter notebook # launch the Jupyter Notebook App
```
Useful commands:
```
$ clear # clear the command line
$ Ctr-C # shut-down the Jupyter Notebook
```
